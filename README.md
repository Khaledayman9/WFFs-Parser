# WFF-Parser
A Prolog-based parser for well-formed formulas (WFFs) of a first-order logic language using definite clause grammars (DCGs) to generate a parse tree for valid WFFs. The language specifications include a predefined alphabet, sets of variables, constants, function symbols, predicate symbols, and syncategorematic symbols.
